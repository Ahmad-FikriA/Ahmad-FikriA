### 🚀 Featured Projects

#### 🟡 Roblox Top-Up Platform — Freelance Project

I worked on API integration, payment workflow, and frontend implementation.

- Integrated Roblox API to fetch username, game world, and gamepass data  
- Built the payment flow UI  
- Integrated Duitku payment gateway for real transactions  

**Outcome:** The platform successfully processed real customer purchases and gave me hands-on experience working with third-party APIs and transaction flows.

A mobile app to support corporate maintenance workflows, including dashboards, work-orders, issue tracking, and equipment logs.

- Gathered requirements and translated them into working features  
- Implemented core maintenance workflows and technician/admin features  

**Outcome:** Delivered a functional prototype that streamlined preventive-maintenance tasks and strengthened my understanding of Flutter architecture and Supabase integration.
